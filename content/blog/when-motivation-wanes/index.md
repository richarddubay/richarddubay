Have you ever had one of those weeks where you’re just not feeling it? Motivation has vanished and it’s hard to get anything moving? That was my week this week. I struggled with feeling rested. I struggled to find joy in what I was doing. It was just a hard week.

I also had this blog post deadline looming over my head. I made a promise at the beginning of this year that I would write and publish one blog post a week. It’s not a lot by any stretch. Some people write a blog post a day. Some more than that. But for me and where I am in my life, one a week seemed like it was doable and something I could consistently hit. So what do you do when you run out of motivation to write?

I want to write a book or books. I want to write about Jesus. I want to write about your heart and how central it is to your life. I want to write about living an intentional life. I want to write about passions, and missions, and your purpose.

All the “experts” that I’ve read say that if I want to attract a tribe that I need to stay focused on the main thing or things that I want to write about and never stray from those things. If I want to attract an audience of people that will eventually buy my books or seminars or “whatevers”, then I need to only write about the things that those items will address. That way I attract a crowd of people who want that information.

I love those topics and I truly plan on writing about them more and more as time goes on. But this week I really just have a bunch of questions.

- What do you do when you just don’t have the motivation to write about a particular thing anymore and you have to post something?
- What if the thing that I am most jazzed about right this moment is a trailer for the latest Marvel movie? What if I just posted a link to the trailer and called it a day? Would that be enough?
- What happens when I don’t have anything inspiring or helpful to say?
- Would it be better just to skip the post I said I was going to write rather than post something that might not be along the same vein as the general topics that I want to cover?

These are the questions running through my head today. If you have any feedback or help, I’d love to hear it!
