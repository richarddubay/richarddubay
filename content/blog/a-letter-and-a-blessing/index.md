My son turned 21 years old this past week. Where has the time gone?

It’s true what they say. The days are long but the years are short.

In the spirit of this milestone, I wanted to share a letter and a blessing that I wrote for him.

## A Letter

Trae,

I remember the day you were born. I can vividly recall how scared I was when I called 911 and the ambulance took your mom to the hospital. I remember driving as fast as I had ever driven to try to catch up with them. To this day I’ve never driven faster.

I can picture how, after you were born, they placed you in that little plastic bin (for lack of a better word) while they measured and weighed you. I remember how you held onto my pinky finger with everything you had. How you looked me in the face and I could tell that you knew my voice.

I remember so many things.

- Your first haircut (gosh did you need it!).
- Playing “I’m too fast for you” as you tried to throw your cup (or anything really) off the tray of your booster seat.
- How we had this whole thing I had to say to you when you were going to bed about how you were “A mighty man of God. A valiant warrior. A champion and a winner,” and about 15 other things.
- Playing “hockey” with you in the playroom at the apartment when you would try to shoot a plastic golf ball past me.
- “Look how close you are to that touchdown.”
- How you would want to run a football play and then you’d want to run the same play, but slower so that you could call the replay.
- That time you got busted in the face with the ball when you were playing soccer and you just kept right on going.
- When you got your black belt in Tae Kwon Do.
- When you got cast in your first play as the dad and you killed it. Killed. It.
- How you share my love of video games. Actually, you’ve probably _surpassed_ my love of video games. 😂

And so much more.

You were so much fun at every age you’ve been. And just when I thought there was no way it was going to be better the next year … it was better the next year.

I’ve had the distinct pleasure of watching you grow up. I’ve been blessed to be able to lead and teach you all these years. I’m so grateful for the opportunity given to me by God to be your dad.

But it doesn’t end here. Just because your 21 doesn’t mean that I’m done being your father. There is so much more in store for the future.

This isn’t a lament. It’s a looking forward to.

This isn’t a reflection on the “good ol’ days”. This is a turning to the future and all that God has for us. For you.

I want you to know that I love you. That as long as God lets me be here I will be available to you. To teach and to guide. For questions or just a listening ear. You don’t have to do this life alone. I am here to love, and correct, and guide, and help, and cheer.

I can’t wait to share in what’s next.

## A Blessing For You

You will be a great man of God.
This isn’t a wish or an “if”. It’s a “will be”.

It’s not something you can run from.
It’s who you are. Deep down in your bones.

You are a mighty man of God.
A force to be reckoned with.

You are a valiant warrior.
You are strong and mighty in battle.

Your battle is not against flesh and blood. It never has been.
You are marked and the devil is scared of you.

Put on your armor. Grab your shield and sword.
Stand up to the arrows of the evil one.

You are a champion and a winner.
Hold on to the Lord with all you have. Look Him in the face. Listen for His voice.

This is how you run the race.
This is how you finish well.

I love you.
