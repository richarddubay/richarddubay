I wanted to share just one thought for this week. Here it is:

**Seek God in everything.**

If there is one thing I’ve learned over the course of my life it is that God is way better at this whole life thing than I am. He knows what’s happened, what’s currently happening, and what’s going to happen. He knows what’s best for me even when (_especially when_) I don’t. 

So often I try to go it on my own. I make the mistake of thinking that I know better than God does. After all, it’s my life, right? That, or I simply don’t think to ask Him what I should be doing and instead rely on my own thoughts or intuition to take me to the next place in my life. 

That’s usually when things turn out wrong. 

Thinking that we know our way in this life better than the One who created us in the first place is laughable.

Yet we do it all the time, don’t we? I know I do. 

This is a lesson I’m still learning. 

Maybe think of it this way. If you had a way to know what the best choices for you in life were going to be, wouldn’t you use that way every time? If you had a person in your life that always knew the right thing to do in any situation, wouldn’t you seek them out before you made any decision ever? 

I think I would. 

And yet I often make the mistake of thinking that I know what’s best for me or I know the right thing to do. I trust myself to make decisions that I shouldn’t be making. 

Now, don’t get me wrong, God is no fortune teller. He isn’t just someone you pay to read your palm or tell you the future. He is not a Magic Eight Ball. 

Yes, He knows the future and holds it in His hand. The big difference here is that God actually _cares_ for you. He cares about your wellbeing and He wants what’s best for you. No fortune teller or device can ever say that. 

God sees way further down the path of your life than you ever could. He also cares way more for you and your future than anyone (including you) ever would. He wants what is best for you and loves you with a love that won’t let go.

So put your future (and your decisions) in the hands of the One who created the universe. Ask Him what’s best for you. Seek Him in all you do. From small to big, in every area of your life, ask Him what you should do and He will direct your path.
