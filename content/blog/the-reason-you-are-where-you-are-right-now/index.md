**Spoiler Alert**: It’s because you’ve **chosen** to be there.

You are where you are in your life because of the choices that you’ve made in the past. Consequently, the choices that you make today will determine where you are tomorrow. So it stands to reason that if you want a different life, you should make different choices.

You don’t have to settle for the 9 to 5 that you hate. You don’t have to come home and watch 5 hours of TV every night. You don’t have to hang around that same crowd of people that just sit around and bash everything and everyone; those same people that will bash this post because they don’t want to change.

You can be different. It’s your choice.

You can decide that you want a different career. You can study, work hard, and make the choices necessary to get the job or own the business that sets your heart on fire. Instead of watching TV every night, spend that time working on your side hustle. You can get a new group of friends. People that uplift and affirm each other and can see the good in life and can speak into your heart instead of tearing it out.

Now, I realize you may not have started out in the best of circumstances. You were born into this or that family. You didn’t choose to not have a dad or a mom. It wasn’t your choice to be abused. I want to acknowledge these. They are completely and totally valid. They happened and they matter. The thing is, you DO NOT have to let that thing define you. You can rise above your circumstances. You can be different. It starts with your choices.

Study anyone who has made it “big” and I guarantee you will hear many stories of people that started out in pretty bad situations. How did they move from those situations to where they are now? They were determined to get out of that situation and move on. They decided what they wanted and then made choices to get there. Those same choices are available to you.

The power to change your life lies in the choices your make. Your choices may not be popular with those around you. But that’s okay because they aren’t going anywhere anyway. Remember, this is your life, not theirs.

**Choose to be different**. Go after your dreams.

**Choose to break the mold**. The most successful people don’t follow the status quo.

**Choose to be above average**. Why would you settle for anything less?

**Choose wisely**. Your life depends on it.
