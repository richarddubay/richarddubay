> For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. - 2 Timothy 1:7

There is a lot of fear going around right now. I’d go so far as to say that it has a stranglehold on the entire world.

Coronavirus (or specifically, COVID-19) has got everyone on edge.

The media, which sensationalizes everything, would have you believe that “the end is near!”

That is fear mongering at it’s finest.

I am definitely not a health expert. I am no doctor or nurse or any kind of health practitioner. And I honestly don’t know that much about this particular disease.

What I do know is that fear has a grip on us all and there seems to be no stopping it.

But here’s the deal, fear is not from God. There are many fruits of the Spirit, but fear is not one of them. Fear is just another of Satan’s ploys to get you to stop following God and start following anything else.

In 2 Timothy above, we can see that fear is not something that God gives us. He instead gives us power, and love, and a sound mind.

God gives us the ability to think clearly and be level-headed about even the most incredible, fantastic, and terrible things that could come our way.

Perhaps the Coronavirus is terrible. Maybe it really is a pandemic as the World Health Organization claims it is. It definitely has spread across the world at a rapid rate.

So does the common cold. Or the flu. Should I be fearful of them?

Yes, wash your hands. Yes, cough or sneeze into your sleeve. These are things you should be doing anyway.

But stay away from fear. Be careful and alert, but be wise and clear-headed. Jesus said:

> Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. - John 14:27

Don’t let your hearts be troubled friends. Satan is a roaring lion just looking for someone to devour. Don’t let him devour you. Stand firm and in peace, whatever comes your way.

And please, if you’re sick, stay home. They give you sick days for a reason. 😷
