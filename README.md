# Long Live the Personal Site

Hi!

Thanks for stopping by. This is the repo for my personal site. It's powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It is constantly under construction and I hope it's getting better all the time.

## Why Did I Build This?

I'm a developer. I've been coding in one language or another, building websites and apps for over 20 years. This is me, continually learning, constantly experimenting, and desiring to get better at my trade all the time.

Plus, more and more I'm falling in love with writing. I wanted a place, a home for my writing that I had control over. A space that I could make my own. This is that space.

So welcome. Please feel free to contact me with any issues, comments, and questions. I'd love to help if I can.
