You know how you lose? It’s really simple. All you have to do is just freaking sit there and do nothing. Forever.

Do you want to win? You want to write that book, or start that podcast, or be a freaking movie star? Do you have a dream inside of you that you are hoping against hope will come true? It’s not going to happen if you just sit there and do the same things you’ve done every day of your life.

Do you want to know how to make your dreams come true? You know how you win? You start.

Freaking do something. Anything.

Momentum is the killer app, my friends.

Are you scared of failure? Who cares if you fail? At least if you try and fail (even glorious, massive, in public failure) you’re still doing more than 99% of the people you know. Probably more than 99% of people in the WORLD. And only 1% of those people have an opinion that should matter to you. That’s like your spouse if you’re married and maybe like your Mom or something.

Admittedly, there are times when even the 1% won’t get what you’re doing. And that’s okay. But really, who gives a crap about the other 99%? Why do you care what they think? They can say all the stuff they want about you. They can say you’re lazy, or fat, or stupid, or a waste of a human being all they want. But they aren’t going to pay your rent next month. They aren’t putting food on your table. You are. Until the people who are calling you names are the ones paying to keep the lights on or the water running you have no reason to listen to anything they say. Their opinion of you doesn’t matter at all. Seriously. ZERO percent. Your opinion of you matters 100%. When you allow THEIR opinion to become YOUR opinion, you’ve lost.

Most of the time, those people haven’t even said anything about you yet. You’re just scared of what they might say. You’ve said it all to yourself in your head and you’re afraid you’re going to hear it from someone else. You’re letting someone else beat you who doesn’t even know you’re alive yet. If they are going to beat you (or beat you up with their words) then man … let them know you’re alive first.

You have to be the one to do whatever it is that makes you come alive. No one is going to do that for you. You’ve got to be willing to do whatever it takes. It’s all on you.

Just start.
