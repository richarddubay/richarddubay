Welcome back everyone!

It’s been a long time, hasn’t it? It’s hard to believe it’s been over a year since I last posted here. Time flies, doesn’t it?

Right off the bat I want to apologize for taking such a long break. I didn’t plan it, but it just sort of ended up happening. Everything was cruising along really well and then, one semi-large life change later ( I got a new job!), I’ve let a lot of things fall off. Instead of directing my life where it was supposed to go, I let life take me where it wanted to go. Which isn’t _always_ bad (there’s something to be said for spontaneity and the ebb and flow of life after all), but it isn’t _always_ good either. If I could quote myself from my blog post [_A Small Story is No Story at All_](https://www.richarddubay.com/2020/10/09/a-small-story-is-no-story-at-all/):

> You see, your life (like your body) is constantly is search of stasis. It wants a happy place where it knows what is going to happen and can handle the things that are coming. Your life, if left to its own devices, wants to plateau.

And that’s exactly what happened.

I’ll save the details for a later time but it’ll suffice for now to say that what I’ve found is that your life doesn’t want to just plateau, it wants to sink. It wants to become worse than it was before.

The good news is that with the right motivation and drive, a correct amount of determination and effort, and a focus on the right calling, you can move things back in the upward direction.

I’m tired of the way things have gone this past year. Kind of ashamed at how much I’ve gone backward in my life. It’s time to push things forward again. Small steps, like writing daily or getting back into habits and routines that I have pushed off for so long, are on the menu again.

I am ready to get back to it. I’ve got a lot of work to do and we only get a little time on this earth. Best get to it, yeah?

## So what are we doing here? What’s the purpose of this blog now? What are you going to write about?

Before my hiatus, this blog centered around Jesus, goal setting, productivity, and maybe a few other things sprinkled in there. I don’t see that changing. My calling in this life is “to use technology to reach people for Jesus” and I see no reason why that would stop now. A lot of times I see blogs that do well are focused on one thing. They have themes. This is a “productivity blog.” That is a “mommy blog.” And I think that’s great. But I don’t think that makes sense here.

This is my personal blog. It’s personal to me. So it should be made up of things that I find interesting, right? My hope is that you find what I write here helpful or inspiring, but I’d be kidding myself if I thought that all of you would find everything interesting that I find interesting. You aren’t me. There is no way that you have the exact same interests as I do. And that’s okay. You don’t have to. If I ever write one post that encourages you, or helps you in some way, or heck, even just makes you laugh or somehow makes your day better, then I will have done my job. Maybe you move one step closer in to Jesus. Man, what a win that would be.

So I’ll probably write about a lot of things. Some topics that come to mind are:

- God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.
- Sports
- TV / Movies / Entertainment
- Theater
- Book Writing
- Fitness / The process of getting healthy
- Habits / Goals
- Beards / Grooming
- Short stories (?!?!)

At the end of the day, I guess I’ll write about whatever feels most important or top of mind at the time.

Some weeks you might like it. Other weeks you might skip it all together. And that’s okay. I certainly hope you’ll stick around and see what’s next. If there is ever a topic that you’d like to see me write about, by all means let me know.

For now let me just say that it’s a joy to be back and writing again. Thanks for coming along on the ride with me. Let’s see where we end up.

P.S. Just a heads up for all of you detail oriented folks out there who tend to notice these things: It’s also time for a website refresh. So you’ll probably notice some changes over time. Thanks for understanding.
