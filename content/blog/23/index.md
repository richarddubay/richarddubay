I am not much of a poet. But I wrote this for Heather because itâ€™s our wedding anniversary this weekend. Gosh I love that lady. 

â€”

Peaches  
In heavy syrup  
Nah, just kidding  
Thatâ€™s awkward  

Five foot three  
And three-quarters  
Short hair  
Donâ€™t care  

Lilac  
Cherry Blossom  
Succulent  
Hufflepuff  

Hummingbirds  
Deer in our yard  
Snakes in our shed  
Mouse in our house (Eek!)  

2 kids  
Trae and Aiden  
When did they grow up?  
The best gifts from God  

Tacos  
Brisket  
Brisket Tacos!  
Spicy  

Hockey  
Football  
UFC  
I am blessed  

The king returns  
Han shot first  
Jason Bourne  
The nose plays ðŸ˜‰  

Wonder Woman  
Cosplay  
Superhero  
Is what you are  

Beautiful  
My darling  
My favorite  
Baby  

Life with you  
From that first day until now  
Is the best life  
Beyond my imagination  

Hard times  
Fun times  
Some times  
Messy  

Every time  
For all time  
Without question  
I choose you  

Grateful  
Thankful  
Hopeful  
Is how I feel when I see your face  

The best part of my day  
Healing power and resting place  
I feel at home  
In your arms  

Happy anniversary  
Half my life  
Spent married to you  
Literally  

Best decision  
Would do again  
Would recommend  
10/10  

â€”

Happy anniversary my beautiful lady!
