Every day on my way to and from work I drive on a bridge over a lake. It’s not the shortest way to get to where I need to go. It’s actually kind of out of the way if I’m being honest.

But I take that route on purpose. It’s an intentional choice.

As the tree-lined road opens up and I burst forth onto the bridge my mind and heart do something that they don’t usually do for the majority of the day: they give way to gratefulness. My mind stops churning on whatever thing I was thinking about. My heart stops and catches a glimpse of something beautiful. I am instantly drawn out of all of “my” things and into the heart of Someone who cares about me. When I’m in His heart, I can’t help but be grateful.

When I take the time to think about it, I really am grateful for so many things. For my wife and my children. For my family and friends. For a God who loves me. For all that I get to be and do and hear and see.

My commute, one way, is around 30 minutes. That ride across the bridge maybe takes one. But in that one minute my world is put back in the right perspective and my heart breathes again.

Almost every day, no matter the weather, I am reminded of what beauty looks like. I am once again refreshed. I can’t help but be grateful.

Gratitude changes everything.
