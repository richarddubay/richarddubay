I have to confess … I haven’t been living very intentionally lately.

I’ve let my life be dictated by the situations around me. Instead of telling my life what to do I’ve been letting my life tell me what to do.

When you allow life to take you where it wants you to go you will end up in all the places you don’t want to be.

Life will take your money and tell you that living paycheck to paycheck and in debt is cool.

Life will take your time and tell you that busyness and hustle is the way to get ahead in life. It will threaten you and remind you how you don’t want to be left behind by all the rest of the “grinders” out there.

You will stop making time for the important things and instead work as much and as often as you can. You will start to skip “quiet time” for “I can get 30 minutes of work in before I head to work.”

You will stop making intentional choices with you diet and start eating whatever is in front of you. You will make bad choices at the grocery store. Because you have less money and time you will choose what’s cheap and not what’s best.

At least, this is what I have found is true for me. I didn’t even recognize that I was doing this at first. It was a revelation to me that I didn’t enjoy.

But there is joy in revelation. Even if the revelation hurts. We can always make corrections. We can always change direction. We can always choose differently.

I want to start to choose intention. I don’t want to be driven along by the whims of the world. Instead, I want to choose to do the right things … even if they’re hard. I want to redeem my time and use it wisely. I want to start to make the right decisions right away.

If you find yourself living unintentionally as well, I’m here for you. We can do this together.
