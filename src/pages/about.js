                    spending my life in pursuit of a greater calling than seeing
                    Jesus change peoples lives and making Him famous through

                    Iâ€™m also a writer. I am passionate about helping people find
                    their purpose and rediscover their passions. Thatâ€™s the main
                    purpose of this site. I also write about God, technology,
                    writing (ironically), and other sundry things.

                    I fall more in love with writing all the time. The more I do
                    it, the more I love it. One story, one paragraph, one
                    sentence, or even one word can change someones life. Thatâ€™s
                    a great power not to be taken lightly. Also, the personal
                    blog has taken a hit recently, but it's do for a comeback. I
                    want to be here when it does.
