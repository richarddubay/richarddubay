God has not called us to merely exist.

He has plans for you far beyond you wildest dreams. Plans that He put in place, meant specifically for you, before there even was a “you”.

> For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
> – Ephesians 2:10

He has hopes and dreams for you. He has a purpose for you. Something way more than bingeing the latest series on Netflix or Disney+ (Although, “Baby Yoda”, right?).

He has an adventure waiting for you. A calling. A mission. Did you know that? Do you know what it is? Something meant to stretch and challenge you. Something made and set aside just for you, on purpose, so that you would grow into the person He wants you to be.

You are meant for more than merely existing. You are meant for fairy tale. That might sound weird, but hang with me. What is a fairy tale if not adventure, drama, and fellowship. You are meant for that. You were made to storm the castle, to tame the savage beast, and to rescue those in need.

But fairy tales are not for the faint of heart, are they? It won’t be easy. Adventures rarely are. If it was easy, could you really call it an “adventure”?

In _Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2_, with regard to his return to Swallow Falls to battle food monsters, Flint Lockwood says “It’s going to be deadly dangerous with a good chance of death.”

That, my friends, is what awaits you in your adventure; your fairy tale. There will be danger and evil. There is an enemy whose sole purpose is to destroy you. But if you don’t take up the mantle, if you shrink back even an inch, the kingdom will fall. You are the only one who can accomplish this mission. Your mission, your adventure, your fairy tale … it’s meant only for you.

## You’re Not Alone

Just because your mission is meant for you alone doesn’t mean that you’ll be in this all by yourself. I mean, what good fairy tale only involves one person?

Like Frodo in _The Lord of the Rings_, you will need a fellowship. Others to come along side you on your journey. They will be there to help you on the way. To help you see your blind spots, lay down cover fire for you in the heat of battle, and be a shoulder when things get really tough. You’ll do the same for others on their journeys.

## “Your mission, should you choose to accept it.”

There is also a choice. You can choose to not go on the adventure. To say “no” to the mission. You can stay at home where it’s safe and warm and you know what to expect.

But if you do then all is lost. All that is beautiful will burn. The beauty will never be rescued. The dragon, your enemy, will ruin and destroy all.

The choice is up to you.

You’re in your fairy tale right now. Your mission is upon you. What adventure awaits you? It is time to make a decision. Are you going to stay at home, or step up and be the hero?

You are being called. Some large adventure awaits you. Are you listening?
