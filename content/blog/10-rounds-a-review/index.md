_Disclaimer_: I‚Äôll admit ‚Ä¶ I have no idea how to write a product review and make it interesting and fun. So here‚Äôs to giving it a shot ‚Ä¶ and hoping it‚Äôs not too dry and boring. Thanks for reading!

I revealed to you last week that I finished an online, at-home workout for the first time ever. This was (and still is) a huge deal for me. After years and years of trying and failing to finish, after so long of thinking I was a failure, I was finally able to complete a program. It‚Äôs a big deal not just to my body, but also to my spirit.

I thought I‚Äôd write up a little review of the program that finally got me over the hump.

## Soulmate Workout?

If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned over the years through my attempts at physical fitness, it‚Äôs that there are just some types of workouts you enjoy more than others. I‚Äôve heard it called your ‚Äúsoulmate workout.‚Äù

For me that type of workout has been weightlifting. I can get more excited for and more enjoyment from a good weightlifting workout than I can almost any other kind of workout.

Side note: I‚Äôm a secret bodybuilding fan. I actually follow some bodybuilders and watch their YouTube channels and for a while there even got into watching some competitions. There‚Äôs just something about bodybuilding that motivates me. Now granted I don‚Äôt have the genetic structure to be able to do what they do, but the motivation is there nonetheless.

I think if I had to pick a second favorite workout type it would be something with punching and kicking. I remember back when I was trying to do _P90X_ that I really enjoyed the Kenpo workout. That one was fun.

Outside of punching and kicking, I‚Äôve never really enjoyed any other form of cardio. I don‚Äôt enjoy running, or swimming, or jumping, or ‚Ä¶ you name it. I know cardio is important. I want a healthy heart after all. But none of it interests me.

One thing that my wife has taught me is that you need to find the things you like and that keep you motivated to do them over and over again. That‚Äôs when fitness will ‚Äústick‚Äù and you‚Äôll be more likely to continue to do it for a long time into the future.

## Enter _10 Rounds_

As the title of this post suggests, the workout program I completed is called _10 Rounds_. It‚Äôs made by Beachbody, the same company that produced the world famous _P90X_, _Insanity_, _21 Day Fix_, and many others.

When I read up on the program before purchasing it, what I found was a boxing-inspired workout program with some weight training. As we just discussed, I like lifting weights and if I‚Äôm going to do cardio, I might as well be punching, right? This program sounded like a win from the beginning.

## What is the Program Like?

_10 Rounds_ is a 6-week program in which you workout 5 days a week. 3 of those days are boxing and 2 are weightlifting. No two workouts are the same. Every day is something different and you never do the same workout twice. This is great for all of you who get bored doing the same workout over and over again.

Over the course of the 6 weeks you learn all the basic boxing moves. You‚Äôll learn 6 basic punches that you will use in different combinations over and over again. You‚Äôll put those combinations together with movement as well. Stepping forward and back, stepping side to side for starters. Then shuffles, fans, slips, rolls ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll learn it all.

It‚Äôs important to note that this is a progression. You build up slowly over the course of the program. They don‚Äôt expect you to know it all from the opening bell.

## Boxing Days

The boxing days are, like the name of the program implies, broken up into ten 3-minute rounds. The rounds go like this:

- Warm-up
- Boxing
- Boxing
- Conditioning
- Boxing
- Boxing
- Conditioning
- Boxing
- Boxing
- Core

Now the boxing rounds are where you do your ‚Ä¶ well, boxing. üòÑ The conditioning rounds are basically just cardio. But it‚Äôs boxing-based cardio. So that‚Äôs helpful. And each workout ends with core work.

## Weight Training Days

You do 2 weight lifting workouts each week. One is upper body and the other is lower body. The workouts vary from week to week. Some weeks it‚Äôs one body part at a time until your done and then you move on to the next. Other weeks it‚Äôs supersets. Sometimes it‚Äôs a circuit. I found the variety of exercises and types of workouts to be fun.

## Modifying

I did want to mention that there is no modifier. A lot of Beachbody‚Äôs programs have one ‚Ä¶ this one doesn‚Äôt. Everyone in the cast does the full workout the entire time. Joel (the trainer) does explain and demonstrate any modifications should you need them. This usually happens in the conditioning rounds and during the weight lifting workouts. Boxing is just boxing. Throw those punches!

## Overall

This program is so much fun. Coming from a guy who has always wanted to be fit but never really wanted to work out all that much, that‚Äôs saying a lot. If you like punching and weight lifting like I do, this just might be the program for you. Here‚Äôs a trailer for the program so you can see just what you‚Äôre getting yourself into:

If you think _10 Rounds_ might be something you‚Äôd like to try and haven‚Äôt already got a Beachbody coach or account, you should contact my wife. Heather has been a Beachbody coach for a long time and can help set you up with all the things you need to make it happen and answer any questions you might have. She‚Äôs @intentionallyft on pretty much all the social media things. Also, you can find out more information about the program through [this link](https://www.teambeachbody.com/shop/us/b/fitness/10rounds?referringRepId=35984). Note that this is an affiliate link and if you sign up to do the program from here you will be automatically assigned to have Heather as your coach. Which is _definitely not_ a bad thing. She's awesome.

## What‚Äôs Next

Rest assured, I enjoyed this program so much that I will do it again. I do think I‚Äôm going to try something else before I go back to it though. Right now it‚Äôs looking like my next program might be _LIIFT 4_. This is a combination weight training and HIIT (high intensity interval training) program with the same trainer as _10 Rounds_. I think I‚Äôd like to give this one a shot.

So if you get going and do _10 Rounds_ now then in 9 or 10 weeks we could both do our second rounds of it together! Who‚Äôs in?
