What do I share in such a time as this?

We are in the midst of an outbreak of a disease whose repercussions are potentially longer lasting and more devastating that anything I’ve seen in my lifetime.

I talked [last week](https://www.richarddubay.com/2020/03/13/fear/) about fear. I don’t feel fearful. Thanks be to God.

I do have to acknowledge the seriousness of what we’re experiencing though. To ignore it would be unwise. I refuse to obsessively watch the news and give in to the fear they would have me believe in. I do, however, believe that this is a serious thing worthy of my respect and that we should be extremely careful in how we respond to it.

As Christians, we have a great opportunity in front of us. In a world that would continue to spiral into chaos and confusion, what a great chance we have to be love and peace; to be a shelter in the midst of the storm.

We are bearers of light and hope.

> Galadriel: And for you, Frodo Baggins, I give you the light of Eärendil our most beloved star. May it be a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out.
>
> – The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King

Frodo went on to use that light in his battle with the spider Shelob. As the battle progressed and things were looking grim and that darkness would win, Frodo remembered the light he had been given and used it to push the spider (and the darkness) back.

So can we. We are bearers of light. This is not the time for us to hide. This is an opportunity for us to stand up and shine. To point the way to the One who is light. To light the way to He who can lead all others out of darkness.

Maybe we can’t physically get together with each other. That doesn’t mean that we can’t be an encouraging voice in the midst of chaos. Virtually high-five your family across the country. Help others where you can, when you can. Be generous with your stuff and money where it’s possible. Don’t hog all the toilet paper.

At the end of the day, in the middle of the storm everyone is looking for peace. Jesus was able to speak to the storm and tell it to cease. In [Mark 4:35-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+4%3A35-41&version=NIV), He brought peace in the midst of the storm. Christian, you have that peace too. A peace that transcends understanding.

> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
>
> – Philippians 4:7

Do you see that? God has a peace that no one can understand … and it’s yours. It will guard your heart and your mind. In a land where all seems hopeless, where the darkness seems to be winning, you can have peace. You can give that peace to others.

There's this worship song called _Tremble_ that I feel fits so perfectly in these days. It has become a prayer of mine recently. Part of it says:

> Peace, bring it all to peace
>
> The storm surrounding me
>
> Let it break at Your name
>
> Still, call the sea to still
>
> The rage in me to still
>
> Every wave at Your name
>
> Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
>
> Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
>
> Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
>
> Jesus, Jesus
>
> Your name is a light that the shadows can't deny
>
> Your name cannot be overcome
>
> Your name is alive, forever lifted high
>
> Your name cannot be overcome

What we all need right now is peace. We need someone that can calm our fears. We are craving relief like a cold drink of water to a parched throat in the middle of an endless desert.

That someone is Jesus. The one who makes the darkness tremble. The one who silences fear.

That same Jesus lives in you. You have something that so many others need so badly right now. Give it away friends. Give it all away.
