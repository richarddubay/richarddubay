A little child, wrapped in swaddling clothes and born in a manger.

Little baby Jesus so meek and mild.

So innocent and pure, the tiny little lamb of God.

We’ve made Jesus out to be some cute little painting. Someone who wouldn’t hurt a fly. Some little waif of a man whose greatest goal is world peace. Someone who just wants us all to get along.

We couldn’t be further from the truth.

[Revelation chapter 12](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/REV.12.NIV) tells us of the child’s birth and the war that resulted because of it. First, war in heaven. Then war on the rest of us. You should go read the whole thing, it’s remarkable. But a couple of bits here.

First, verses 7 & 8:

> Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.

Verse 17:

> Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.

That doesn't sound like the story we get in a lot of our Christmas carols, does it? That's war. But remember, Jesus' goal isn't world peace, it's our freedom. Sometimes, to bring freedom, there has to a battle.

In Jesus’ own words, Matthew 10:34:

> “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.”

Jesus came to fight. To trample Satan and his kingdom and to provide a way out of the bondage that we find ourselves in.

> “The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, … “ – Isaiah 61:1

This was Jesus’ mission. He came to this earth and fulfilled it. He overcame the kingdom of darkness and has provided a rescue for us. Satan is defeated, friends. The invasion was a success.

What a night that was, the night Jesus was born.

> A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
>
> For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
>
> Fall on your knees
>
> O hear the angels' voices
>
> O night divine

“O night divine” indeed.
